# Games - C#

Games currently playable:

1 Hangman - Two player game.


Description:

An ongoing project comprising of a menu driven compendium of one and two plyer games.  
The technologies used are C#, .Net 5.0, MS SQL Server Express and Visual Studio 2019.


This is/was my 'hello world' project, to allow me to get to grips and understand the above mentioned technologies. 
This is my very first project and so I appreciate the code is perhaps not as succinct nor as efficient as it could be,
however I shall eneavour to improve it as my knowledge and skills grow.

The code attempts to demonstrate my understanding of the following concepts:

1) Use of classes and nested classes. 
2) Member scope (local/global).
3) Members - static/none static methods, class variables, properties.
4) Data types (value/reference) and structures including objects, lists and enums.
4) Database connectivity using ADO.Net, executing database commands and manipulating returned data.
5) Database concents - Tables and table relationships, queries, stored procedures.
6) Writing to external files.
7) Reflection using basic late binding techniques.
8) Garbage collection including IDisposable and Using keyword.

If nothing else, I hope you enjoy playing my interpretation of the game(s)!
